Our age has inherited the whole argument. The focus, however, has changed. It seldom concerns Truth anymore. Even if Truth does exist, it’s of little help to us in our world and our lives because it is beyond human understanding. Even many people of strong and rather conservative religious views no longer consider the question of Truth important to the understanding or practice of their faith.

Still, the question of truth, or even truths, remains, and the position we take toward this question does have an important bearing on how we conduct our thinking and acting. Unfortunately, there is a good deal of  murkiness and confusion about the concept. The rest of this chapter will attempt to shed light on it.

It’s fashionable today to believe that truth is relative and subjective. “Everyone creates his or her own truth,” the saying goes, “and what is true for you may not be true for me.” The meaning of this statement goes far beyond “It’s a free country and I can believe what I want.” The claim means that whatever a person thinks is true because he or she thinks it is. Not surprisingly, to challenge another person’s view on an issue is considered bad form. “That’s my truth you’re talking about, Buster. Show a little respect.”





我们这个时代继承了整个论点。然而，焦点已经改变。它不再关注真理。即使真理确实存在，它对我们的世界和生活也没有什么帮助，因为它超出了人类的理解范围。即使是许多宗教观念强烈且相当保守的人，也不再认为真理问题对于理解或实践自己的信仰很重要。

尽管如此，真理甚至真理的问题依然存在，我们对这个问题所持的立场确实对我们如何进行思考和行动有着重要的影响。遗憾的是，关于这一概念存在着大量的模糊和混乱。本章的其余部分将试图对此加以说明。

当今流行一种观点，认为真理是相对的、主观的。俗话说，"每个人都创造了自己的真理"，"对你来说是真理的东西，对我来说未必是真理"。这句话的含义远远超出了 "这是一个自由的国家，我可以相信我想相信的东西"。这句话的意思是，无论一个人认为什么都是真的，因为他或她认为它是真的。毫不奇怪，在某个问题上质疑他人的观点会被认为是不好的行为。"你说的是我的真理，小子。放尊重点"。
