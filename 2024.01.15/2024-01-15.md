Students sometimes get the idea that a textbook must be read page by page and that reading ahead violates some unwritten rule. This notion is
mistaken. Students’ background knowledge varies widely; what one student knows very well, another knows only vaguely and a third is totally
unfamiliar with. Any time you need or want to look ahead to an explanation in a later chapter, by all means do so. Let’s say you make a statement
and a friend says, “That’s relativism, pure and simple.” If you aren’t sure exactly what she means, go to the index, look up “relativism,” proceed to
the appropriate page, and find out.

Looking ahead is especially prudent in the case of concepts and procedures relevant to the end-of-chapter applications. One such concept is
plagiarism. If you are not completely clear on what constitutes plagiarism,why it is unacceptable, and how to avoid it, take a few minutes right now to learn. Look for the section “Avoiding Plagiarism” toward the end of the Chapter 2. Similarly, if you are not as skilled as you would like to be doing library or Internet research, it would be a good idea to read Chapter 17 now. Doing so could save you a great deal of time and effort completing homework assignments.







学生有时会认为，教科书必须一页一页地读，提前阅读违反了一些不成文的规定。这种想法是 错误的。学生的背景知识千差万别；一个学生非常熟悉的知识，另一个学生只是略知一二，而第三个学生则完全不熟悉。完全不熟悉。任何时候，如果你需要或想查阅后面章节中的解释，都可以这样做。比方说，你做了一个陈述 朋友说："这就是相对主义，纯粹而简单"。如果你不确定她说的到底是什么意思，那就去索引中查找 "相对主义"，然后翻到相应的页面，找出答案。到相应的页面，就会知道了。

对于与章末应用相关的概念和程序，瞻前顾后尤其重要。其中一个概念是剽窃。如果你还不完全清楚什么是抄袭、为什么不能接受抄袭以及如何避免抄袭，现在就花几分钟时间学习一下。请查找第 2 章末尾的 "避免抄袭 "部分。同样，如果你在图书馆或互联网上做研究的技巧不够熟练，最好现在就阅读第 17 章。这样做可以节省你完成家庭作业的大量时间和精力。
