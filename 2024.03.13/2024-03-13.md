Characteristics of Critical Thinkers

A number of misconceptions exist about critical thinking. One is that being able to support beliefs with reasons makes one a critical thinker.
Virtually everyone has reasons, however weak they may be. The test of critical thinking is whether the reasons are good and sufficient.

Another misconception is that critical thinkers never imitate others in thought or action. If that were the case, then every eccentric would be a
critical thinker. Critical thinking means making sound decisions, regardless of how common or uncommon those decisions are.

It is also a misconception that critical thinking is synonymous with having a lot of right answers in one’s head. There’s nothing wrong with
having right answers, of course. But critical thinking involves the process of finding answers when they are not so readily available.

And yet another misconception is that critical thinking cannot be learned, that one either has it or does not. On the contrary, critical thinking
is a matter of habit. The most careless, sloppy thinker can become a critical thinker by developing the characteristics of a critical thinker. This
is not to say that all people have equal thinking potential but rather that everyone can achieve dramatic improvement.

批判性思考者的特征

关于批判性思维存在许多误解。 一是能够用理由支持信念使人成为批判性思考者。
几乎每个人都有理由，无论它们有多弱。 批判性思维的考验是理由是否充分且充分。

另一个误解是批判性思考者从不模仿他人的思想或行动。 如果是这样的话，那么每个怪人都将是一个
批判性思想家。 批判性思维意味着做出正确的决定，无论这些决定有多常见或不常见。

认为批判性思维就是头脑中拥有很多正确答案的同义词，这也是一种误解。 没有什么问题
当然有正确的答案。 但批判性思维涉及在答案不易获得时寻找答案的过程。

还有一个误解是，批判性思维是无法习得的，要么有，要么没有。 相反，批判性思维
是一个习惯问题。 通过培养批判性思考者的特征，最粗心、草率的思考者也可以成为批判性思考者。 这
并不是说所有人都具有平等的思维潜力，而是说每个人都可以取得巨大的进步。
