The social and psychological theories of our time also have an impact on our beliefs. Before the past few decades, people were urged to be self-disciplined,self-critical, and self-effacing. They were urged to practice self-denial,to aspire to self-knowledge, to behave in a manner that ensured they maintained self-respect. Self-centeredness was considered a vice.“Hard work,” they were told, “leads to achievement, and that in turn produces 
satisfaction and self-confidence.” By and large, our grandparents internalized those teachings. When they honored them in their behavior,they felt proud; when they dishonored them, they felt ashamed.

  Today the theories have been changed—indeed, almost exactly  reversed. Self-esteem, which nineteenth-century satirist Ambrose Bierce defined as “an erroneous appraisement,” is now considered an imperative. Self-centeredness has been transformed from vice into virtue, and people who devote their lives to helping others, people once considered heroic and saintlike, are now said to be afflicted with “a disease to please.” The formula for success and happiness begins with feeling good about ourselves. Students who do poorly in school, workers who don’t measure up to the challenges of their jobs, substance abusers, lawbreakers—all are typically diagnosed as deficient in self-esteem.

In addition, just as our grandparents internalized the social and psychological theories of their time, so most contemporary Americans have
internalized the message of self-esteem. We hear people speak of it over coffee; we hear it endlessly invoked on talk shows. Challenges to its precepts
are usually met with disapproval.



我们这个时代的社会和心理学理论也对我们的信仰产生了影响。在过去几十年之前，人们被要求自律、自我批评和自我克制。他们被要求克己奉公，渴望自知，行为举止要确保自尊。以自我为中心被认为是一种恶习。他们被告知，""努力工作"会带来成就，而成就又会产生满足感和自信心"。总的来说，我们的祖父母将这些教诲内化于心。当他们在行为中遵守这些教诲时，他们感到自豪；当他们不遵守这些教诲时，他们感到羞愧。

  如今，这些理论已经发生了变化，事实上，几乎完全颠倒了过来。十九世纪的讽刺作家安布罗斯-比尔斯（Ambrose Bierce）将自尊定义为 "一种错误的评价"，而现在自尊被认为是一种必须。以自我为中心已经从恶习变成了美德，而那些毕生致力于帮助他人的人，那些曾经被认为是英雄和圣人的人，现在却被说成是患上了 "讨好病"。成功和幸福的公式始于自我感觉良好。学习成绩差的学生、无法应对工作挑战的工人、药物滥用者、违法者--所有这些人通常都被诊断为缺乏自尊。

此外，正如我们的祖父母将他们那个时代的社会和心理学理论内化一样，大多数当代美国人也 内化了自尊的信息。我们在喝咖啡时听到人们谈论自尊，我们在脱口秀节目中听到人们无休止地援引自尊。对自尊的质疑 通常会遭到反对。
