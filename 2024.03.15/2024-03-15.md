Uncritical Thinkers . . .

1. Pretend they know more than they do, ignore their limitations,and assume their views are error-free.
2. Regard problems and controversial issues as nuisances  or threats to their ego.
3. Are impatient with complexity and thus would rather remain  confused than make the effort to understand.
4. Base judgments on first impressions and gut reactions. They are unconcerned  about the amount or quality of evidence and cling to their views  steadfastly.
5. Are preoccupied with themselves and their own opinions  and so are unwilling to pay attention to others’ views. At  the first sign of disagreement, they tend to think, “How can I refute this?”
6. Ignore the need for balance and give preference to views that support their established views.
7. Tend to follow their feelings and act impulsively.

As the desirable qualities suggest, critical thinking depends on mental discipline. Effective thinkers exert control over their mental life, direct their thoughts rather than being directed by them, and withhold their endorsement of any idea—even their own—until they have tested and confirmed it. John Dewey equated this mental discipline with freedom. That is, he argued that people who do not have it are not free persons but slaves to whim or circumstance: 

If a man’s actions are not guided by thoughtful conclusions, then they are guided by inconsiderate impulse, unbalanced appetite, caprice, or
the circumstances of the moment. To cultivate unhindered, unreflective external activity is to foster enslavement, for it leaves the person at the
mercy of appetite, sense, and circumstance 





不批判的思想家 . .

1. 假装自己比别人知道得更多，忽视自己的局限性，认为自己的观点没有错误。
2. 把问题和有争议的问题视为麻烦或对自我的威胁。
3. 对复杂的问题缺乏耐心，因此宁愿保持困惑，也不愿努力去理解。
4. 根据第一印象和直觉反应做出判断。他们不关心证据的数量或质量，坚定不移地坚持自己的观点。
5. 只顾自己和自己的观点，不愿理会他人的观点。一有不同意见，他们就会想 "我该如何反驳呢？
6. 忽视平衡的必要性，倾向于支持自己既定观点的观点。
7. 往往跟着感觉走，冲动行事。

正如这些可取的品质所表明的，批判性思维依赖于心理纪律。有效的思考者会控制自己的精神生活，引导自己的思想，而不是被思想所引导，并且在检验和确认任何观点之前，都不会对其表示赞同，哪怕是自己的观点。约翰-杜威将这种精神约束等同于自由。也就是说，他认为没有这种精神修养的人不是自由的人，而是心血来潮或环境的奴隶： 

如果一个人的行为不是以深思熟虑的结论为指导，那么他的行为就是受不周到的冲动、不平衡的胃口、任性或一时的环境所左右。的指导。培养不受阻碍、不加思索的外在活动就是培养奴役，因为这会让人听任 食欲、理智和环境的摆布
