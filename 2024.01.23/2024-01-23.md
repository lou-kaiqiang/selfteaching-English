This manipulation has prevented many people from developing a mature attention span. They expect the classroom and the workplace to provide the same constant excitement they get from television. That, of course, is an impossible demand, and when it isn’t met they call their teachers boring and their work unfulfilling. Because such people seldom have the patience to read books that require them to think, many publishers have replaced serious books with light fare written by celebrities.

Even when writers of serious books do manage to become published authors, they are often directed to give short, dramatic answers during
promotional interviews, sometimes at the expense of accuracy. A man who coaches writers for talk shows offered one client this advice: “If I ask
you whether the budget deficit is a good thing or a bad thing, you should not say, ‘Well, it stimulates the economy but it passes on a burden.’ You have to say ‘It’s a great idea!’ or ‘It’s a terrible idea!’ It doesn’t matter which.” (Translation: ”Don’t give a balanced answer. Give an oversimplified one because it will get you noticed.”)

Print journalism is also in the grip of sensationalism. As a newspaper editor observed, “Journalists keep trying to find people who are at 1 or at
9 on a scale of 1 to 10 rather than people at 3 to 7 [the more moderate positions] where most people actually are.” Another journalist claims,“News is now becoming more opinion than verified fact. Journalists are slipping into entertainment rather than telling us the verified facts we need to know.”







这种操纵使许多人无法形成成熟的注意力。他们期望课堂和工作场所能像电视一样给他们带来持续的刺激。当然，这是不可能实现的要求，一旦达不到，他们就会说老师无趣，工作没有成就感。因为这些人很少有耐心阅读需要他们思考的书籍，所以许多出版商用名人写的轻松读物取代了严肃书籍。

即使严肃书籍的作者成功地成为了出版作家，他们在接受宣传采访时也常常被要求给出简短、戏剧化的回答，有时甚至以牺牲准确性为代价。一位为脱口秀节目指导作家的人向一位客户提出了这样的建议： "如果我问你，预算赤字是好事还是坏事，你不应该说'嗯，它刺激了经济，但也带来了负担'。'你必须说'这是一个好主意！'或者'这是一个糟糕的主意！'。'哪个都无所谓"。(译者注 "不要给出一个平衡的答案。给出一个过于简单的答案，因为这会让你受到关注"）。

印刷新闻业也被煽情主义所控制。正如一位报纸编辑所言："记者们总是试图找到那些在 1 到 10 的评分中处于 1 分或 9 分的人，而不是处于 3 到 7 分（比较温和的位置）的人，而实际上大多数人都处于这样的位置。另一位记者称："新闻现在变得更多的是观点，而不是经过核实的事实。记者们正在滑向娱乐化，而不是告诉我们需要知道的经过核实的事实"。
