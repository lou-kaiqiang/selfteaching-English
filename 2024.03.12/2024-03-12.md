In contrast to feeling, thinking is a conscious mental process performed  to solve a problem, make a decision, or gain understanding. Whereas feeling has no purpose beyond expressing itself, thinking aims

思维可分为三大类：反思性思维、创造性思维和批判性思维。 本书的重点是批判性思维。 批判性思维的本质是评价。 因此，批判性思维可以被定义为我们检验主张和论点并确定哪些有价值、哪些没有价值的过程。 换句话说，批判性思维是寻找答案、探索的过程。 毫不奇怪，批判性思维中最重要的技巧之一就是提出探究性问题。 如果不加批判地接受他们的第一想法和其他人的陈述的表面价值，批判性思考者就会以这种方式挑战所有想法：
