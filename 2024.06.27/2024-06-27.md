The vagaries of perception have long been noted by those who deal with human testimony—notably, trial lawyers, police officers, and psychologists. It is well established that a number of factors can make us see and hear inaccurately. Darkness, cloudy conditions, or distance from what we are witnessing may obscure our vision. We may be distracted at a crucial moment. If we are tired or in the grip of powerful emotions such as fear or anger, our normal perceptiveness may be significantly diminished. Also, perception may be intermingled with interpretation—the expectation that an event will unfold in a certain way may color our perception of the way the event actually unfolds. Loyalty and affection toward the people or things involved may distort our vision as well. If someone we dislike speaks in a loud voice and is animated, we may regard that person as showing off to get attention. But if a friend behaves in the same way, we may regard him or her as vivacious and extroverted.

Even when our perception is initially flawless, our memory often distorts the data. We forget details, and when later attempting to recall what happened we resort to imagination to fill in the blanks. Though we may at first be aware that such a process of reconstruction is occurring, this awareness soon fades, and we come to believe we are remembering the original perception.

处理人类证词的人--特别是出庭律师、警官和心理学家--早已注意到感知的变化无常。众所周知，有许多因素会使我们的视听出现偏差。黑暗、阴天或距离我们目睹的事物较远，都可能模糊我们的视线。在关键时刻，我们可能会分心。如果我们疲惫不堪，或被恐惧或愤怒等强烈情绪所控制，我们的正常感知能力可能会大大降低。此外，感知可能会与解释交织在一起--对事件将以某种方式发展的预期可能会影响我们对事件实际发展方式的感知。对所涉及的人或事的忠诚和喜爱也会扭曲我们的视野。如果我们不喜欢的人说话声音很大，表情很生动，我们可能会认为他是在炫耀自己，以引起别人的注意。但如果朋友也有同样的行为，我们可能会认为他或她活泼外向。

即使我们的感知最初是无懈可击的，我们的记忆也常常会扭曲数据。我们会忘记一些细节，当后来试图回忆起发生过的事情时，我们就会借助想象来填补空白。虽然一开始我们可能意识到这种重构过程正在发生，但这种意识很快就会消失，我们会相信自己正在回忆最初的感知。
