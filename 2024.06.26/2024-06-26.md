We are told about the world before we see it. We imagine most things before we experience them. And those preconceptions, unless education has made us acutely aware, govern deeply the whole process of perception. They mark out certain objects as familiar or strange, emphasizing the difference, so that the slightly familiar is seen as very familiar, and the somewhat strange as sharply alien. They are aroused by small signs, which may vary from a true index to a vague analogy. Aroused, they flood fresh vision with older images, and project into the world what has been resurrected in memory.

You have heard the old saying seeing is believing. The reverse— believing is seeing—is equally correct. To a greater or lesser extent, what we regard as our unique perspective bears the imprint of other people’s
ideas and beliefs.

Is perception flawless? Hardly. For one thing, it is influenced by our desires, interests, and expectations: “From the outset perception is selective and tends to simplify the world around us. Memory continues and hastens the process.” For another, even within its limited focus, perception is often flawed. A college student who is positive that the textbook contains a certain statement answers an exam question with perfect confidence. Yet when the student gets the corrected test back and finds the question marked wrong, then hurriedly flips open the book and examines the passage again, he or she may find it says something else entirely.

我们在看到世界之前，就已经被告知了它的存在。我们在体验大多数事物之前都会对其进行想象。而这些先入为主的观念，除非教育使我们敏锐地意识到，否则会深深地支配着整个感知过程。它们把某些物体标示为熟悉或陌生，强调它们之间的区别，因此，稍微熟悉的东西就会被看成非常熟悉，而稍微陌生的东西就会被看成非常陌生。微小的迹象都会唤醒它们，这些迹象可能是真实的索引，也可能是模糊的类比。被唤醒后，它们会在新的视觉中充斥着旧的图像，并将记忆中复活的东西投射到世界中。

你一定听说过 "眼见为实 "这句老话。反过来说--相信就是看见--也同样正确。我们所认为的独特视角或多或少都带有其他人的观念和信仰的印记。观念和信仰的印记。

感知是完美无瑕的吗？很难说。首先，它受到我们的欲望、兴趣和期望的影响： "从一开始，感知就是有选择性的，它倾向于简化我们周围的世界。记忆会继续并加速这一过程"。其次，即使在有限的关注范围内，感知也往往是有缺陷的。一个大学生在回答一道考题时，肯定地认为教科书中包含了某句话。然而，当该学生拿回改好的试卷，发现问题标错了，然后匆忙翻开书，再次检查这段话时，他或她可能会发现它说的完全是另一句话。
