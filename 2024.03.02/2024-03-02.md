But isn’t the theory of self-esteem self-evident? No. A negative perception of our abilities will, of course, handicap our performance.
Dr. Maxwell Maltz explains the amazing results one educator had in improving the grades of schoolchildren by changing their self-images.
The educator had observed that when the children saw themselves as stupid in a particular subject (or stupid in general), they unconsciously
acted to confirm their self-images. They believed they were stupid, so they acted that way. Reasoning that it was their defeatist attitude rather
than any lack of ability that was undermining their efforts, the educator  set out to change their self-images. He found that when he accomplished
that, they no longer behaved stupidly! Maltz concludes from this and other examples that our experiences can work a kind of self-hypnotism on us,
suggesting a conclusion about ourselves and then urging us to make it come true.

Many proponents of self-esteem went far beyond Maltz’s demonstration  that self-confidence is an important ingredient in success. They
claimed that there is no such thing as too much self-esteem. Research does not support that claim. For example, Martin Seligman, an eminent
research psychologist and founder of the movement known as positive psychology, cites significant evidence that, rather than solving personal
and social problems, including depression, the modern emphasis on self-esteem causes them.





但是，自尊理论难道不是不言自明的吗？对自己能力的消极看法当然会影响我们的表现。 麦克斯韦尔-马尔兹博士（Dr. Maxwell Maltz）解释了一位教育家通过改变学童的自我形象来提高他们成绩的惊人成果。 这位教育家观察到，当孩子们认为自己在某一科目上很笨（或总的来说很笨）时，他们会不自觉地 行动来证实他们的自我形象。他们认为自己很笨，所以就那样做。他们认为是自己的失败主义态度，而不是能力的缺乏削弱了他们的能力。于是，这位教育家开始着手改变他们的自我形象。他发现 他们就不再表现得愚蠢了！马尔兹从这个例子和其他例子中得出结论，我们的经历会对我们产生一种自我催眠的作用、 暗示我们自己的结论，然后敦促我们将其变成现实。

许多自尊的支持者远远超出了马尔兹的论证，即自信是成功的重要因素。他们 他们声称，自尊并不存在过多这一说法。研究并不支持这种说法。例如，马丁-塞利格曼（Martin Seligman）是一位杰出的 例如，著名心理学家、积极心理学运动创始人马丁-塞利格曼（Martin Seligman）列举了大量证据，证明自尊非但不能解决包括抑郁在内的个人和社会问题，反而会让人变得更加自卑。塞利格曼列举了大量证据表明，现代社会对自尊的强调非但没有解决包括抑郁症在内的个人和社会问题，反而造成了这些问题。
