The Role of Intuition

Intuition is commonly defined as immediate perception or comprehension of something—that is, sensing or understanding something without the use of reasoning. Some everyday experiences seem to support this definition. You may have met a stranger and instantly “known” that you would be partners for life. When a car salesman told you that the price he was quoting you was his final, rock-bottom price, your intuition may have told you he was lying. On the first day of a particular course, you may have had a strong sense that you would not do well in it.

These facts have led some scholars to conclude that intuition is simply a consequence of thinking. They would say that something about the stranger appealed to you, something the salesman said or did suggested insincerity, something about the professor frightened you. In each case, they would explain, you made a quick decision—so quick, in fact, that you were unaware that you’d been thinking. In the case of the breakthrough ideas, the scholars would say that when people become engrossed in problems or issues, their unconscious minds often continue working on them long after they have turned their attention elsewhere. Thus, when an insight seems to come “out of nowhere,” it is actually a delayed result of thinking.



直觉的作用

直觉通常被定义为对事物的直接感知或理解，也就是说，不用推理就能感知或理解事物。一些日常经验似乎也支持这一定义。你可能遇到过一个陌生人，并立刻 "知道 "你们会成为终身伴侣。当汽车销售员告诉你，他给你报的价格是他的最终底价时，你的直觉可能告诉你他在撒谎。在学习某门课程的第一天，你可能强烈地感觉到自己学不好这门课。

这些事实让一些学者得出结论，直觉只是思考的结果。他们会说，陌生人的某些地方吸引了你，推销员的某些言行让你感到不真诚，教授的某些地方让你感到害怕。他们会解释说，在每种情况下，你都会迅速做出决定--事实上是如此之快，以至于你都没有意识到自己一直在思考。关于突破性的想法，学者们会说，当人们沉迷于问题或议题时，他们的无意识思维往往会在他们将注意力转移到别处很久之后仍在继续研究这些问题或议题。因此，当洞察力看似 "凭空出现 "时，它实际上是思考的延迟结果。
