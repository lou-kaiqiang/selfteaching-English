Similarly, research has shown that human memory can be manipulated.The way a question is asked can change the details in a person’s memory and even make a person remember something that never happened!

Of course, advertisers and people with political or social agendas are not content to stimulate emotions and/or plant ideas in our minds. They
also seek to reinforce those impressions by repeating them again and again. The more people hear a slogan or talking point, the more familiar it
becomes. Before long, it becomes indistinguishable from ideas developed through careful thought. Sadly, “the packaging is often done so effectively
that the viewer, listener, or reader does not make up his own mind at all. Instead, he inserts a packaged opinion into his mind, somewhat like inserting a DVD into a DVD player. He then pushes a button and ‘plays back’ the opinion whenever it seems appropriate to do so. He has performed acceptably without having had to think.Many of the beliefs we hold dearest and defend most vigorously may have been planted in our minds in just this way.

Many years ago, Harry A. Overstreet noted that “a climate of opinion, like a physical climate, is so pervasive a thing that those who live within it and know no other take it for granted.”The rise of mass culture and the sophisticated use of manipulation have made this insight more relevant today than ever.

同样，研究表明，人的记忆可以被操纵。提问的方式可以改变一个人记忆中的细节，甚至让一个人记住一些从未发生过的事情！

当然，广告商和怀有政治或社会目的的人并不满足于在我们的头脑中激发情感和/或植入观念。他们还试图通过反复重复来强化这些印象。人们听到的口号或观点越多，就越熟悉。越熟悉。不久之后，这些口号或观点就会与经过深思熟虑后形成的想法难以区分。可悲的是，"包装往往做得如此有效
以至于观众、听众或读者根本无法做出自己的判断。相反，他把包装好的观点塞进自己的头脑，有点像把 DVD 放进 DVD 播放器。然后，只要觉得合适，他就会按下按钮，"回放 "这些观点。许多我们最珍视和极力捍卫的信念可能就是以这种方式植入我们的头脑的。

多年前，哈里-A-奥弗斯特里特（Harry A. Overstreet）曾指出："舆论氛围就像自然气候一样，是一种无处不在的东西，以至于那些生活在其中而又不了解其他事物的人认为它是理所当然的。"大众文化的兴起和操纵手段的巧妙运用使这一见解在今天比以往任何时候都更具现实意义。
