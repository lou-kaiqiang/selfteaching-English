Today’s politicians often manipulate people more offensively than do journalists. Instead of expressing their thoughts, some politicians find out what people think and pretend to share their ideas. Many politicians hire people to conduct polls and focus groups to learn what messages will “sell.” They even go so far as to test the impact of certain words—that is why we hear so much about “trust,” “family,” “character,” and “values”these days. Political science professor Larry Sabato says that during the Clinton impeachment trial, the president’s advisors used the term private lives over and over—James Carville used it six times in one four-minute speech—because they knew it could persuade people into believing the president’s lying under oath was of no great consequence.

 The “Science” of Manipulation
Attempts to influence the thoughts and actions of others are no doubt as old as time, but manipulation did not become a science until the early twentieth century, when Ivan Pavlov, a Russian professor of psychology,published his research on conditioned (learned) reflexes. Pavlov found that by ringing a bell when he fed a dog, he could condition the dog to drool at the sound of the bell even when no food was presented. An American psychologist, John Watson, was impressed with Pavlov’s findings and applied them to human behavior. In Watson’s most famous experiment,he let a baby touch a laboratory rat. At first, the baby was unafraid. But then Watson hit a hammer against metal whenever the baby reached out to touch the rat, and the baby became frightened and cried. In time, the baby cried not only at the sight of the rat but also at the sight of anything furry, such as a stuffed animal.* Watson’s work earned him the title “father of behaviorism.”



与记者相比，当今的政客操纵民众的手段往往更令人反感。一些政客不表达自己的想法，而是去了解人们的想法，并假装与他们的想法一致。许多政客雇人进行民意调查和焦点小组，以了解哪些信息会 "畅销"。他们甚至不惜测试某些词语的影响力--这就是为什么我们现在经常听到 "信任"、"家庭"、"品格 "和 "价值观"。政治学教授拉里-萨巴托（Larry Sabato）说，在克林顿弹劾案的审判过程中，总统的顾问们一遍又一遍地使用 "私生活 "这个词--詹姆斯-卡维尔（James Carville）在一次四分钟的演讲中使用了六次--因为他们知道，这个词可以说服人们相信，总统在宣誓时撒谎并没有什么大不了的。

试图影响他人思想和行为的做法无疑由来已久，但直到 20 世纪初，俄罗斯心理学教授伊万-巴甫洛夫（Ivan Pavlov）发表了他对条件反射（习得性）的研究成果，操纵才成为一门科学。巴甫洛夫发现，通过在喂狗时摇铃，他可以让狗一听到铃声就流口水，即使在没有食物的情况下也是如此。美国心理学家约翰-沃森对巴甫洛夫的发现印象深刻，并将其应用于人类行为。在沃森最著名的实验中，他让一个婴儿触摸实验鼠。起初，婴儿并不害怕。但后来，每当婴儿伸手去摸老鼠时，沃森就用锤子敲打金属，婴儿受到了惊吓，哭了起来。久而久之，婴儿不仅看到老鼠会哭，看到任何毛茸茸的东西，比如毛绒玩具，也会哭。
