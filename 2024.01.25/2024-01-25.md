Less well known is Watson’s application of behaviorist principles to advertising. He spent the latter part of his career working for advertising
agencies and soon recognized that the most effective appeal to consumers was not to the mind but to the emotions. He advised advertisers to “tell
[the consumer] something that will tie him up with fear, something that will stir up a mild rage, that will call out an affectionate or love response,
or strike at a deep psychological or habit need.” His attitude toward the consumer is perhaps best indicated by a statement he made in a presentation
to department store executives: “The consumer is to the manufacturer,the department stores and the advertising agencies, what the green  frog is to the physiologist.

Watson introduced these strategies in the 1920s and 1930s, the age of newspapers and radio. Since the advent of television, these advertising
strategies have grown more sophisticated and effective, so much so that many individuals and groups with political and social agendas have adopted them. The strategies work for a number of reasons, the chief one being people’s conviction that they are impervious to manipulation. This belief is mistaken, as many researchers have demonstrated. For example, Solomon Asch showed that people’s reactions can be altered simply by changing the order of words in a series. He asked study participants to evaluate a person by a series of adjectives. When he put positive adjectives first—”intelligent, industrious, impulsive, critical, stubborn, envious”—the participants gave a positive evaluation. When he reversed the order, with “envious” coming first and “intelligent” last, they gave a negative evaluation.

沃森将行为主义原理应用于广告业，这一点却鲜为人知。他职业生涯的后半段都在为广告公司工作，并很快认识到，对消费者最有效的吸引力不在于头脑，而在于情感。他建议广告人 "告诉［消费者］一些能让他感到恐惧的事情，一些能激起轻微愤怒的事情，一些能唤起亲情或爱情反应的事情，或者一些能触动深层心理或习惯需求的事情"。他对消费者的态度或许可以从他对百货公司高管的一次演讲中所说的话中得到最好的体现,： "消费者之于制造商、百货公司和广告公司，就像青蛙之于生理学家。



沃森是在二十世纪二三十年代，也就是报纸和广播的时代提出这些策略的。自电视问世以来，这些广告策略变得越来越复杂和有效，以至于许多怀有政治和社会目的的个人和团体都采用了这些策略。这些策略之所以奏效，原因有很多，其中最主要的是人们相信自己不会被操纵。正如许多研究人员所证明的那样，这种信念是错误的。例如，所罗门-阿什（Solomon Asch）证明，只需改变一系列词语的顺序，就能改变人们的反应。他要求研究参与者用一系列形容词来评价一个人。当他把正面的形容词放在前面时--"聪明、勤奋、冲动、挑剔、固执、嫉妒"--参与者给出了正面的评价。当他把顺序颠倒过来，把 "嫉妒 "放在第一位，把 "聪明 "放在最后时，参与者给出的是负面评价。
