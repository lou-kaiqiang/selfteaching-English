Most modern researchers use the word mind synonymously with brain, as if the physical organ that resides in the human skull were solely responsible for thinking. This practice conveniently presupposes that a problem that has challenged the greatest thinkers for millennia—the relationship between mind and physical matter—was somehow solved when no one was looking. The problem itself and the individuals who spent their lives wrestling with it deserve better.

Neuroscience has provided a number of valuable insights into the cognitive or thinking activities of the brain. It has documented that the  left hemisphere of the brain deals mainly with detailed language processing and is associated with analysis and logical thinking, that the right hemisphere deals mainly with sensory images and is associated with intuition and creative thinking, and that the small bundle of nerves that lies between the hemispheres—the corpus callosum—integrates the various functions.

The research that produced these insights showed that the brain is  necessary for thought, but it has not shown that the brain is sufficient for thought. In fact, many philosophers claim it can never show that. They  argue that the mind and the brain are demonstrably different. Whereas the brain is a physical entity composed of matter and therefore subject to decay, the mind is a metaphysical entity. Examine brain cells under the most powerful microscope and you will never see an idea or concept— for example, beauty, government, equality, or love—because ideas and concepts are not material entities and so have no physical dimension. Where, then, do these nonmaterial things reside? In the nonmaterial mind.

大多数现代研究人员将 "心智"（mind）一词与 "大脑"（brain）同义，似乎只有人类头骨中的物理器官才负责思考。这种做法很方便地预设了一个千年来一直挑战着最伟大思想家的问题--思维与物理物质之间的关系--已经在无人注意的时候以某种方式解决了。这个问题本身以及那些毕生与之搏斗的人们理应得到更好的解决。

神经科学对大脑的认知或思维活动提出了许多有价值的见解。据记载，大脑左半球主要处理详细的语言处理，与分析和逻辑思维有关；右半球主要处理感官图像，与直觉和创造性思维有关；位于大脑两半球之间的一小束神经--胼胝体--将各种功能整合在一起。

产生这些见解的研究表明，大脑是思维的必要条件，但并没有表明大脑是思维的充分条件。事实上，许多哲学家声称，研究永远无法证明这一点。他们认为，思维和大脑显然是不同的。大脑是由物质组成的实体，因此会衰变，而心灵则是形而上学的实体。在最强大的显微镜下观察脑细胞，你永远不会看到思想或概念--例如，美、政府、平等或爱--因为思想和概念不是物质实体，所以没有物理维度。那么，这些非物质的东西在哪里呢？在非物质的心灵中。
