Writing may be used for either of two broad purposes: to discover ideas or to communicate them. Most of the writing you have done in school is undoubtedly the latter kind. But the former can be very helpful, not only in sorting out ideas you’ve already produced, but also in stimulating the flow of new ideas. For some reason, the very act of writing down one idea seems to generate additional ideas.

Whenever you write to discover ideas, focus on the issue you are examining and record all your thoughts, questions, and assertions. Don’t worry about organization or correctness. If ideas come slowly, be patient. If they come suddenly, in a rush, don’t try to slow down the process and develop any one of them; simply jot them all down. (There will be time for elaboration and correction later.) Direct your mind’s effort, but be sensitive to ideas on the fringe of consciousness. Often they, too, will prove valuable.

If you have done your discovery writing well and have thought critically about the ideas you have produced, the task of writing to communicate will be easier and more enjoyable. You will have many more ideas—carefully evaluated ones—to develop and organize.



写作有两大目的：发现思想或交流思想。毫无疑问，你在学校里写的大多数文章都是后者。但前者可能非常有帮助，不仅可以整理你已经产生的想法，还可以激发新想法的产生。出于某种原因，写下一个想法的行为似乎会产生更多的想法。

每当您为发现想法而写作时，请专注于您正在研究的问题，并记录下您的所有想法、问题和论断。不要担心条理或正确性。如果想法来得很慢，请耐心等待。如果想法来得突然，来得匆忙，也不要试图放慢进程，发展其中任何一个想法；只需将它们全部记录下来。(稍后会有时间进行阐述和修正）引导你的思维，但要对意识边缘的想法保持敏感。通常，它们也会被证明是有价值的。

如果你已经很好地完成了探索性写作，并对自己产生的想法进行了批判性思考，那么写作交流的任务就会变得更加轻松愉快。你将会有更多的想法--经过仔细评估的想法--来发展和组织。
