In centuries past, family and teachers were the dominant, and sometimes the only, influence on children. Today, however, the influence exerted by
mass culture (the broadcast media, newspapers, magazines, Internet and popular music) often is greater.

 By age 18 the average teenager has spent 11,000 hours in the classroom and 22,000 hours in front of the television set. He or she has had perhaps 13,000 school lessons yet has watched more than 750,000 commercials. By age thirty-five the same person has had fewer than 20,000 school lessons yet has watched approximately 45,000 hours of television and close to 2 million commercials.

What effects does mass culture have on us? To answer, we need only consider the formats and devices commonly used in the media. Modern advertising typically bombards the public with slogans and testimonials by celebrities. This approach is designed to appeal to emotions and create
artificial needs for products and services. As a result, many people develop the habit of responding emotionally, impulsively, and gullibly to
such appeals. They also tend to acquire values very different from those taught in the home and the school. Ads often portray play as more fulfilling
than work, self-gratification as more desirable than self-control, and materialism as more meaningful than idealism.

大众文化对我们有什么影响？要回答这个问题，我们只需考虑一下媒体常用的形式和手段。现代广告通常用口号和名人推荐来轰炸公众。这种方式旨在唤起人们的情感共鸣，创造出对产品和服务的人为需求。对产品和服务的人为需求。因此，许多人养成了对这些诉求做出感性、冲动和轻信的反应的习惯。的习惯。他们还往往会获得与家庭和学校教育截然不同的价值观。广告往往把游戏描绘成比工作更有意义 自我满足比自我控制更可取，物质主义比理想主义更有意义。
