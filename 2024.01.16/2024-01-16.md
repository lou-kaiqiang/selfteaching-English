Anyone who wishes to master an activity must first understand its tools and rules. This is as true of critical thinking as it is of golf, carpentry,
flying a plane, or brain surgery. In critical thinking, however, the tools are not material objects but concepts, and the rules govern
mental rather than physical performance.

This first section explores seven important concepts—individuality,critical thinking, truth, knowledge, opinion, evidence, and argument—
with a chapter devoted to each. Most of these concepts are so familiar that you may be inclined to wonder whether there is any point to examining
them. The answer is yes, for three reasons. First, much of what is commonly believed about these concepts is mistaken. Second, who ever examines them carefully is always rewarded with fresh insights. Third, the more thorough your knowledge of these concepts, the more proficient you will be in your thinking.

Suppose someone asked, “Who are you?” It would be simple enough to respond with your name. But if the person wanted to know the entire
story about who you are, the question would be more difficult to answer.You’d obviously have to give the details of your height, age, and weight.
You’d also have to include all your sentiments and preferences, even the secret ones you’ve never shared with anyone—your affection for your
loved ones; your desire to please the people you associate with; your dislike of your older sister’s husband; your allegiance to your favorite
beverage, brand of clothing, and music. 

Your attitudes couldn’t be overlooked either—your impatience when an issue gets complex, your aversion to certain courses, your fear of high places and dogs and speaking in public. The list would go on. To be complete, it would have to include all your characteristics—not only the physical but also the emotional and intellectual.

任何人想要掌握一项活动，都必须首先了解其工具和规则。批判性思维与高尔夫、木工、飞机驾驶或脑外科手术一样，都是如此。然而，在批判性思维中，工具不是物质而是概念，规则是政府的而不是身体的表现。

第一部分探讨了七个重要概念--个性、批判性思维、真理、知识、观点、证据和论证，每个概念都有一章专门论述。这些概念大多耳熟能详，您可能会怀疑研究它们是否有意义。答案是肯定的，原因有三。首先，关于这些概念的许多普遍看法都是错误的。其次，仔细研究这些概念的人总是会有新的发现。第三，你对这些概念的了解越透彻，你的思维就会越熟练。

假设有人问："你是谁？回答你的名字很简单。但如果对方想知道你是谁的整个
显然，你必须详细介绍自己的身高、年龄和体重。 你还必须包括你所有的情感和喜好，甚至是你从未与人分享过的秘密--你对亲人的爱 你对亲人的爱，你想取悦交往对象的愿望，你对姐姐丈夫的厌恶，你对最喜欢的饮料、服装品牌和音乐的忠诚 饮料、服装品牌和音乐的忠诚度。

你的态度也不容忽视--当问题变得复杂时你的不耐烦，你对某些课程的反感，你对高处、狗和在公共场合发言的恐惧。这样的例子不胜枚举。为了完整，它必须包括你的所有特征--不仅是身体上的，还有情感和智力上的。
