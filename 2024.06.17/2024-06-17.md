At its best, discussion deepens understanding and promotes problem solving and decision making. At its worst, it frays nerves, creates animosity,and leaves important issues unresolved. Unfortunately, the most prominent models for discussion in contemporary culture—radio and TV talk shows—often produce the latter effects.

Many hosts demand that their guests answer complex questions with  simple “yes” or “no” answers. If the guests respond that way, they are attacked for oversimplifying. If, instead, they try to offer a balanced answer, the host shouts, “You’re not answering the question,” and proceeds to answer it himself. Guests who agree with the host are treated warmly; others are dismissed as ignorant or dishonest. Often as not, when two guests are debating, each takes a turn interrupting while the other shouts, “Let me finish.” Neither shows any desire to learn from the other. Typically, as the show draws to a close, the host thanks the participants for a “vigorous debate” and promises the audience more of the same next time.

Here are some simple guidelines for ensuring that the discussions you engage in—in the classroom, on the job, or at home—are more civil, meaningful, and productive than what you see on TV. By following these guidelines, you will set a good example for the people around you.

1. Whenever possible, prepare in advance.

2. Set reasonable expectations.
3. Leave egotism and personal agendas at the door.
4. Contribute but don’t dominate.
5. Avoid distracting speech mannerisms.
6. Listen actively.
7. Judge ideas responsibly.
8. Resist the urge to shout or interrupt.





在最好的情况下，讨论可以加深理解，促进问题的解决和决策的制定。最糟糕的情况是，讨论会刺激神经，制造敌意，使重要问题得不到解决。不幸的是，当代文化中最突出的讨论模式--广播和电视脱口秀--往往产生后一种效果。

许多主持人要求嘉宾用简单的 "是 "或 "否 "来回答复杂的问题。如果嘉宾这样回答，他们就会被攻击过于简单化。如果嘉宾试图给出一个平衡的答案，主持人就会大喊 "你没有回答问题"，然后自己开始回答。同意主持人观点的嘉宾会受到热情款待，而其他人则会被视为无知或不诚实。当两位嘉宾进行辩论时，往往是两位嘉宾轮流插话，而另一位嘉宾则大喊 "让我说完"。两人都没有向对方学习的意愿。通常情况下，当节目接近尾声时，主持人会感谢参与者进行了一场 "激烈的辩论"，并向观众承诺下次会有更多同样的辩论。

这里有一些简单的指导原则，可以确保你在课堂上、工作中或在家里参与的讨论比你在电视上看到的更文明、更有意义、更富有成效。遵循这些准则，你将为周围的人树立一个好榜样。

1. 尽可能提前做好准备。
2. 设定合理的期望值。
3. 将利己主义和个人目的拒之门外。
4. 出谋划策，但不颐指气使。
5. 避免分散注意力的言谈举止。
6. 积极倾听。
7. 负责任地判断观点
8. 抵制大声喧哗或打断他人发言的冲动。
