Consider, for example, the idea that many teachers and parents express to young children as a way of encouraging them: “If you believe in yourself,
you can succeed at anything.” From this it follows that nothing else but belief—neither talent nor hard work—is necessary for success. The reason the two ideas are equivalent is that their meanings are inseparably linked.

In addition to conveying ideas closely linked to it in meaning, an idea can imply other ideas. For example, the idea that there is no real difference between virtue and vice implies that people should not feel bound by common moral standards. Samuel Johnson had this implication in mind when he said: “But if he does really think that there is no distinction between virtue and vice, why, Sir, when he leaves our houses let us count our spoons.

If we were fully aware of the closely linked meanings and implications of the ideas we encounter, we could easily sort out the sound ones
from the unsound, the wise from the foolish, and the helpful from the harmful. But we are seldom fully aware. In many cases, we take ideas at
face value and embrace them with little or no thought of their associated meanings and implications. In the course of time, our actions are
shaped by those meanings and implications, whether we are aware of them or not.

To appreciate the influence of ideas in people’s lives, consider the series of events set in motion by an idea that was popular in psychology more
than a century ago and whose influence continues to this day—the idea that “intelligence is genetically determined and cannot be increased.



例如，许多教师和家长都会向幼儿表达这样的想法，以此来鼓励他们： "如果你相信自己 你就能在任何事情上取得成功"。由此可见，要想成功，除了信念--既不是天赋，也不是勤奋--别无其他必要条件。这两个观点之所以等同，是因为它们的含义密不可分。

一个观念除了传达与之意义密切相关的观念外，还可以暗示其他观念。例如，"美德与罪恶之间没有真正的区别 "这一观点暗示人们不应受到共同道德标准的约束。塞缪尔-约翰逊（Samuel Johnson）说："但是，如果他真的认为美德和罪恶没有真正的区别，那么他就不应该受到共同道德标准的约束： "但是，如果他真的认为美德与罪恶没有区别，那么，先生，当他离开我们的房子时，让我们数数我们的勺子吧。

如果我们能充分认识到我们所遇到的各种观点之间密切相关的含义和寓意，我们就能很容易地将正确的观点与不正确的观点、明智的观点与不明智的观点区分开来。我们就能很容易地把正确的和不正确的、明智的和愚蠢的、有益的和有害的区分开来。但我们很少能完全意识到这一点。在许多情况下，我们对各种观点 在很多情况下，我们只看表面价值，接受了这些观点，却很少或根本没有考虑它们的相关含义和影响。随着时间的推移，我们的行为 无论我们是否意识到这些意义和影响。

为了了解观念对人们生活的影响，请看一个多世纪前流行于心理学界的观念所引发的一系列事件。这种观点认为 "智力是由基因决定的，无法提高"。
