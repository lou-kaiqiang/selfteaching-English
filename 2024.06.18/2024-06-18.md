Once ideas are put into words and published, they become intellectual property, and the author has the same rights over them as he or she has over a material possession such as a house or a car. The only real difference is that intellectual property is purchased with mental effort rather than money. Anyone who has ever wracked his or her brain trying to solve a problem or trying to put an idea into clear and meaningful words can appreciate how difficult mental effort can be. 

Plagiarism is passing off other people’s ideas or words as one’s own. It is doubly offensive in that it both steals and deceives. In the academic world, plagiarism is considered an ethical violation and is punished by a failing grade for a paper or a course or even by dismissal from the institution. Outside the academy, it is a crime that can be prosecuted if the person to whom the ideas and words belong wishes to bring charges. Either way, the offender suffers dishonor and disgrace, as the following examples illustrate:

Some cases of plagiarism are attributable to intentional dishonesty, others to carelessness. But many, perhaps most, are due to misunderstanding. The instructions “Base your paper on research rather than on 
your own unfounded opinions” and “Don’t present other people’s ideas as your own” seem contradictory and may confuse students, especially if  no clarification is offered. Fortunately, there is a way to honor both instructions and, in the process, to avoid plagiarism.



一旦将想法付诸文字并发表，它们就成为知识产权，作者对其拥有的权利与对房屋或汽车等物质财富拥有的权利相同。唯一真正不同的是，知识产权是用脑力而不是金钱购买的。任何一个曾经绞尽脑汁试图解决问题或试图将一个想法用清晰而有意义的语言表达出来的人，都能体会到脑力劳动是多么困难。

剽窃是将他人的想法或文字冒充为自己的想法或文字。剽窃和剽窃都是双重的冒犯。在学术界，剽窃被视为违反道德的行为，会受到论文或课程不及格甚至被开除的惩罚。在学术界之外，剽窃是一种犯罪，如果思想和文字的归属者愿意提出指控，可以对其进行起诉。无论哪种情况，犯罪者都会蒙受不名誉和耻辱，下面的例子就说明了这一点：

有些剽窃行为可归咎于故意的不诚实，有些则是由于粗心大意。但许多，也许是大多数，是由于误解。"你的论文要以研究为基础，而不是以自己毫无根据的观点为基础 "和 "你的论文要以研究为基础 
不要把别人的观点当作自己的观点 "这两条指示似乎相互矛盾，可能会让学生感到困惑，尤其是在没有任何说明的情况下。幸运的是，有一种方法可以遵守这两条指示，并在此过程中避免抄袭。
