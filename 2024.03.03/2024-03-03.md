Maltz’s research documents that lack of confidence impedes performance,a valuable insight. But such research doesn’t explain why the more global concept of self-esteem has become so dominant. The answer to that question lies in the popularization of the work of humanistic  psychologists  such as Abraham Maslow. Maslow described what he called  the hierarchy of human needs in the form of a pyramid, with physiological needs (food and drink) at the foundation. Above them, in ascending order, are safety needs, the need for belongingness and love, the need for esteem and approval, and aesthetic and cognitive needs (knowledge, understanding, etc.). At the pinnacle is the need for self-actualization, or fulfillment of our potential. In Maslow’s view, the lower needs must be fulfilled before the higher ones. It’s easy to see how the idea that self-esteem must precede achievement was derived from Maslow’s theory.



Other theories might have been adopted, however. A notable one is Austrian psychiatrist Viktor Frankl’s, which was advanced at roughly the
same time as Maslow’s and was based on both Frankl’s professional practice  and his experiences in Hitler’s concentration camps. Frankl argues that
one human need is higher than self-actualization: self-transcendence, the need to rise above narrow absorption with self. According to Frankl, “the
primordial anthropological fact [is] that being human is being always directed,and pointing to something or someone other than oneself: to a
meaning to fulfill or another human being to encounter, a cause to serve or a person to love.” A person becomes fully human “by forgetting himself
and giving himself, overlooking himself and focusing outward.”

 

马尔兹的研究表明，缺乏自信会影响工作表现，这是一个有价值的见解。但这些研究并不能解释为什么自尊这一更具全球性的概念变得如此重要。这个问题的答案在于亚伯拉罕-马斯洛（Abraham Maslow）等人本主义心理学家研究成果的普及。马斯洛以金字塔的形式描述了他所谓的人类需求层次。在生理需求之上，依次是安全需求、归属感和爱的需求、自尊和认可的需求，以及审美和认知需求（知识、理解等）。自我实现的需求或潜能的实现则是最高层次的需求。在马斯洛看来，低级需求必须在高级需求之前得到满足。不难理解，自尊必须先于成就的观点是如何从马斯洛的理论中衍生出来的。

不过，其他理论也可能被采用。其中值得注意的是奥地利精神病学家维克多-弗兰克尔（Viktor Frankl）的理论。该理论与马斯洛的理论大致同时提出，并以弗兰克尔的专业实践和他在希特勒集中营的经历为基础。弗兰克尔认为 人类有一种需求高于自我实现：自我超越，即超越狭隘自我的需求。弗兰克尔认为
最基本的人类学事实[是]，作为人类总是被引导，并指向自己以外的某物或某人：指向要实现的意义，或指向要帮助的另一个人。 要实现的意义或要遇到的另一个人，要服务的事业或要爱的人"。一个人要成为完全的人，"就要忘记自己 并奉献自己，俯瞰自己并向外关注"。
