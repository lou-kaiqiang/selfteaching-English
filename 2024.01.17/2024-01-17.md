To provide all that information would be quite a chore. But suppose the questioner was still curious and asked, “How did you get the way you are?” If your patience were not yet exhausted, chances are you’d answer something like this: “I’m this way because I choose to be, because I’ve considered other sentiments and preferences and attitudes and have made my selections. The ones I have chosen fit my style and personality best.” That answer is natural enough, and in part it’s true. But in a larger sense, it’s not true. The impact of the world on all of us is much greater than most of us realize.

Not only are you a member of a particular species, Homo sapiens, but you also exist at a particular time in the history of that species and in a particular place on the planet. That time and place are defined by specific circumstances, understandings, beliefs, and customs, all of which limit your experience and influence your thought patterns. If you had lived in America in colonial times, you likely would have had no objection to the practice of barring women from serving on a jury, entering into a legal contract, owning property, or voting. If you had lived in the nineteenth century, you would have had no objection to young children being denied an education and being hired out by their parents to work sixteen hours a day, nor would you have given any thought to the special needs of adolescence. (The concept of adolescence was not invented until 1904.)1



提供所有这些信息将是一件非常麻烦的事情。但假设提问者仍然很好奇，问道："你是怎么变成现在这样的？" 如果你的耐心还没有被耗尽 你可能会这样回答 "我是这样的，因为我选择了这样，因为我考虑了其他的情感、喜好和态度，并做出了选择。我所选择的最适合我的风格和个性"。这样的回答很自然，在某种程度上也是对的。但从更广泛的意义上讲，这并不正确。世界对我们所有人的影响比我们大多数人意识到的要大得多。

你不仅是智人这一特定物种的一员，而且还存在于这一物种历史上的某个特定时期和地球上的某个特定地点。这个时间和地点是由特定的环境、理解、信仰和习俗所决定的，所有这些都限制了你的经历，影响了你的思维模式。如果你生活在殖民时代的美国，你很可能不会反对禁止妇女担任陪审团成员、签订法律合同、拥有财产或投票的做法。如果你生活在十九世纪，你也不会反对幼童被剥夺受教育的权利，也不会反对父母雇他们每天工作十六个小时，更不会考虑青春期的特殊需要。(青春期的概念直到 1904 年才被提出）
