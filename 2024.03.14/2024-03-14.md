We have already noted one characteristic of critical thinkers—skill in asking appropriate questions. Another is control of one’s mental activities. John Dewey once observed that more of our time than most of us care to admit is spent “trifling with mental pictures, random recollections, pleasant but unfounded hopes, flitting, half-developed impressions.”  Good thinkers are no exception. However, they have learned better than poor thinkers how to stop that casual, semiconscious drift of images when they wish and how to fix their minds on one specific matter, examine it carefully, and form a judgment about it. They have learned, in other words, how to take charge of their thoughts, to use their minds actively as well as passively.



Critical Thinkers
Are honest with themselves, acknowledging what they don’t know, recognizing their limitations, and being watchful of their own errors.
Regard problems and controversial issues as exciting challenges.
Strive for understanding, keep curiosity alive, remain patient with complexity, and are ready to invest time to overcome confusion.

Base judgments on evidence rather than personal preferences, deferring judgment whenever evidence is insufficient. They revise judgments when  new evidence reveals error.

Are interested in other people’s ideas and so are willing to read and listen attentively, even when they tend to disagree with the other person.

Recognize that extreme views (whether conservative or liberal) are seldom correct, so they avoid them, practice fairmindedness, and seek a balanced view.

Practice restraint, controlling their feelings rather than being controlled by them, and thinking before acting.



我们已经注意到批判性思维者的一个特点--善于提出适当的问题。另一个特点是控制自己的思维活动。约翰-杜威（John Dewey）曾经指出，我们大多数人都不愿意承认，我们的大部分时间都花在了 "琐碎的心理描绘、随意的回忆、愉快但毫无根据的希望、浮光掠影、半成熟的印象 "上。 优秀的思想家也不例外。然而，他们比拙劣的思考者更懂得如何在自己愿意的时候停止这种随意的、半有意识的图像漂移，以及如何将自己的思维固定在一个特定的事物上，仔细研究它，并形成对它的判断。换句话说，他们学会了如何掌控自己的思想，如何主动而不是被动地运用自己的思想。



批判性思维者
对自己诚实，承认自己不知道什么，认识到自己的局限性，警惕自己的错误。
将问题和有争议的问题视为令人兴奋的挑战。
努力寻求理解，保持好奇心，对复杂问题保持耐心，随时准备投入时间克服困惑。

根据证据而不是个人喜好做出判断，一旦证据不足，就推迟做出判断。当新的证据显示错误时，他们会修正判断。

对他人的观点感兴趣，因此愿意认真阅读和倾听，即使他们倾向于不同意对方的观点。

认识到极端的观点（无论是保守的还是自由的）很少是正确的，因此他们避免极端的观点，保持公平的心态，寻求平衡的观点。

保持克制，控制自己的感情而不是被感情所控制，先思考后行动。
