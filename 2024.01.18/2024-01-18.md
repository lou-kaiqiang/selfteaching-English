If you had been raised in the Middle East, you would stand much closer to people you converse with than you do in America. If you had been raised in India, you might be perfectly comfortable having your parents choose your spouse for you. If your native language were Spanish and your knowledge of English modest, you probably would be confused by some English colloquialisms. James Henslin offers two amusing examples of such confusion: Chevrolet Novas initially sold very poorly in Mexico because no va in Spanish means “it doesn’t work”; and Perdue chickens were regarded with a certain suspicion (or worse) because the company’s slogan—”It takes a tough man to make a tender chicken”—became in Spanish “It takes an aroused man to make a chicken affectionate.

To sum up, living in a different age or culture would make you a different person. Even if you rebelled against the values of your time and
place, they still would represent the context of your life—in other words,they still would influence your responses.

When one idea is expressed, closely related ideas are simultaneously conveyed, logically and inescapably.In logic, this kinship is expressed
by the term sequitur, Latin for “it follows.” (The converse is non sequitur,“it does not follow.”



如果你在中东长大，你会比在美国更亲近与你交谈的人。如果你在印度长大，让父母为你选择配偶，你可能会感到非常舒服。如果你的母语是西班牙语，而你的英语水平一般，你可能会对一些英语口语感到困惑。詹姆斯-亨斯林（James Henslin）举了两个有趣的例子来说明这种困惑： 雪佛兰 Novas 最初在墨西哥的销量很差，因为在西班牙语中 no va 的意思是 "不能用"；Perdue 公司的口号 "It takes a tough man to make a tender chicken "在西班牙语中变成了 "It takes an aroused man to make a chicken affectionate"，因此人们对该公司的鸡产生了某种怀疑（甚至更糟）。

总之，生活在不同的时代或文化中会让你成为不同的人。即使你反抗你所处时代和地点的价值观，它们仍然会代表你的生活背景，换句话说，它们仍然会影响你的反应。

在逻辑学中，这种亲缘关系用术语 sequitur 来表示，拉丁语的意思是 "由此及彼"。（反义词是 non sequitur，"不由此及彼"）。
